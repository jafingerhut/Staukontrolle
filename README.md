# Staukontrolle

Public information about congestion control, especially links to
research papers and descriptions of their contents

About the repository name: I could have given it a name like
`congestion-control`, but I used Google Translate to find what that
translated to in several other languages, and loved the look and sound
of `Staukontrolle`.
